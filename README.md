# PostKid

**PostKid** is a lightweight networking tool designed as an IntelliJ IDEA extension.  
Inspired by **Postman**, PostKid provides a simple and efficient way to perform networking tasks directly inside the IntelliJ environment — without the need to install external applications like Postman for basic lightweight networking.

- No need to switch between your IDE and Postman for simple HTTP requests.
- Built using the powerful `OkHttpClient` library.
- Supports basic networking operations like **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE**.

## 🚀 Why PostKid?

While Postman is a fantastic tool, it can often feel too heavy for quick, lightweight networking tasks.  
**PostKid** offers an integrated alternative that saves time and system resources by allowing developers to stay within their IntelliJ workflow for basic API testing.

---
## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Kotlin (or Java) for extension development.
- `OkHttpClient` for handling HTTP requests.
- IntelliJ Platform SDK for building the plugin.

---

## 📦 Installation

Currently, you can install manually by cloning the repository and building the plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobinKumar5986/PostKid
